        &lt;p&gt;
          This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-
          word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous.
          Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The
          sound of it drones. It&rsquo;s like a stuck record. The ear
          demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length,
          and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant
          rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use
          sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the
          reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of
          considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and
          builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the
          drums, the crash of the cymbals&ndash;sounds that say listen to
          this, it is important.

  <h2>Example with Multiple Elements</h2>

  <p class="lead">Text can be styled.</p>

  <div id="multiple-elements"></div>

  <h3><small>CODE</small></h3>
  <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;Readalong lang="en-US" delimiter="word"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span data-verse=&quot;1&quot;&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the
        Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-
        &lt;verse=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The same was in the beginning with God.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span data-verse=&quot;3&quot;&gt;All things were made through him.
        Without him, nothing was made that has been made.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span data-verse=&quot;4&quot;&gt;In him was life, and the life was the
        light of men.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-verse=&quot;5&quot;&gt;The light shines in
        the darkness, and the darkness hasn&rsquo;t overcome it.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt; 
          
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span data-verse=&quot;6&quot;&gt;There came a man, sent from God, whose 
        name was John.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-verse=&quot;7&quot;&gt;The same came as 
        a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all 
        might believe through him.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-verse=&quot;8&quot;&gt;He was 
        not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the 
        light.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-verse=&quot;9&quot;&gt;The true light that 
        enlightens everyone was coming into the world.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
